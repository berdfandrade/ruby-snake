# Ruby Snake

following up Alexander Kovtunov's "Ruby Snake" tutorial : [Gamedev on Ruby? Why not!](https://diatomenterprises.com/gamedev-on-ruby-why-not/)

"This article isn’t about big games with sophisticated graphics, nor will I be creating something like MMORPG (even though, I think it’s possible). In this article, I will be creating a terminal Snake Game.

I know a lot of developers; including myself, who got started in programming because they were crazy about games. They wanted to create something similar to what they had played before, but in the end, for some reason, they are doing programming that has nothing to do with gamedev. So in this article, I will be going through the steps to create a simple game in Ruby language, which most of us use for various web-applications."
